        <p><strong>Section 32 and Contract Drafting</strong></p>

        <p>They liaise with lenders to align financing or mortgage discharges with subdivision timelines, ensuring funds are ready for settlement.</p>
        <p><strong>Electronic Plan Lodgment</strong></p>
        <p>They lodge plans of subdivision with land registries like Land Victoria or Titles Queensland, ensuring compliance with council requirements, such as minimum lot sizes or access easements.</p>
        <p><strong>Owners Corporation Creation</strong></p>
        <p>For multi-unit developments, they establish owners corporations, handling legal setups for shared facilities like driveways or utilities, ensuring compliance with the Owners Corporations Act 2006 (VIC).</p>
        <p><strong>Due Diligence and Settlements</strong></p>
        <p>Comprehensive searches uncover zoning, title, or environmental issues. Settlements via PEXA ensure accurate title transfers for each lot, reducing errors by 90% (industry data).</p>
        <p><strong>Specialized Development Support</strong></p>
